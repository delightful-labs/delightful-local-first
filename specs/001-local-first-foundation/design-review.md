# Core Contract Consistency Review

**Scope**: Specification/design review only. No implementation, executable conformance, or
backend certification. The current branch is `main`; this review creates no branch or commit.

| Plan header named a feature branch that is not checked out                    | Corrected the current branch to main                                                                                            | Documentation no longer implies branch setup occurred                                              |

The contract remains a proposed review draft. These corrections clarify the current requirements;
they do not establish private workspace protection on the native DXOS peer path or change the
approved identity-reuse decision. Cross-app data sharing is deferred from v1.

## Requirement-to-Design Map

“Covered” below means a behavioral draft exists, not an implementation or a passing scenario.

All 22 functional requirements are mapped. This does not upgrade the specification quality
checklist into an implementation-readiness or qualification certificate.

Success-criterion coverage is likewise planned: SC-001/SC-003 preflight/independent integration;
SC-002/SC-009 two real backends with identical portable declarations; SC-004 native identity
flows; SC-005 private workspace isolation; SC-006 offline durable restart; SC-007 readiness/
disposal; SC-008 keyboard-usable embedded compositions; SC-010 optional transaction qualification;
SC-011 identity reuse with disclosed native access. None has been executed by this review.

## Remaining Work Before Dependent Implementation

Constitution wording was reconciled in v1.0.1 in its own review cycle. Source-based FR-015
discovery is now drafted in [ui-discovery.md](ui-discovery.md), including existing DUI status/field
feedback and proposed optional copy/QR primitives. Neither follow-up establishes runtime passes.

1. Refine the behavioral API into exact typed interfaces and the smallest concrete schema/query
   grammar, plus plugin/host ownership of credential, persistence, and interaction adapters. Do not
   design a domain-policy grammar absent an approved consumer requirement. Review these before
   implementation; the current conceptual surface is not a finished SDK.
2. Pin the implementation toolchain/native SDK-server combinations and document their deployment,
   migration, recovery/device flow, synchronization, and diagnostic-retention behavior. Root
   tooling versions do not imply application dependency compatibility.
3. Establish two backends that qualify for the mandatory foundation behaviors before claiming
   cross-backend acceptance. Keep source-backed DXOS access-model limits visible when assessing
   private workspace isolation. Any future domain policy requires explicit consumer approval and
   separate design review.
4. Use the per-backend status matrix in [qualification.md](qualification.md) to separate source
   evidence from unknown mappings and runtime results. Resolve open portable semantics before
   designing qualification scenarios; do not treat the matrix as proof of compatibility.
5. Keep the user-approved request-and-approval cross-app data-sharing direction outside v1. Revisit
   it only after backend capability evaluation and a separately reviewed scope decision.

Core design can continue with required behavior and fail-closed unsupported configurations.
Backend-specific implementation tasks must not claim the above choices/mappings are settled.
No further application capability is made mandatory by this review, and no workaround is selected.

## Validation Performed

Focused Oxfmt checks, whitespace checks, local documentation-link validation, and a static map
of FR-001 through FR-022 and SC-001 through SC-011. These are document checks, not implementation
tests. No dependencies, production source, routes, components, development server, or tests were
added or run.
